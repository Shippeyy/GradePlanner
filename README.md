> Program for optimizing university courses in order to reach a certain weighted grade average as &#34;easy&#34; as possible. <br>
The program was initially created for students of the Technical University of Vienna (aka TU Wien) but can be used by any student really. <br>
Although grading systems, course types and the app language is designed to be used by students of the TU Wien all of these things can be adapted if the demand arises (see section "Contributing") <br>
